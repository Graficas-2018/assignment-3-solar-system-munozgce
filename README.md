# Assignment 3 SolarSystem

Assignment No 3 for the computer graphics course. Using three.js, create a solar system

Rubric:

- Create 8 planets (and pluto), with their respective moons, the sun, and the asteroid field. *Incomplete*
- The planets and moons can be created as spheres.
- EXTRA: For the asteroids, and some of the moons, investigate how to load the geometry from an obj or json file.
- Planets and moons must have their own rotation. *Incomplete*
- The moons have to rotate around the planets, and the planets have to rotate around the sun. *Incomplete*
- Planets, and their orbits, must have scale that showcases the differences between the planets. *Complete*
- Draw the orbit that each planet follows. *Complete*
- Each element must have its own materials, with textures, and normal or bump maps. *Incomplete*
- Most textures can be found here: http://planetpixelemporium.com/
- The rotation of the system has to be controlled with the left mouse button, while the panning has to be controlled with the right mouse button. Scale of the scene can be controlled as in the examples. *Incomplete*

**NOTES**

1. Panning was missing, and the rotation, and scale had an uncaught error.
2. Did not add bump maps.
3. Code was not legible, and variable names were not descriptive. I will assume that *planet_7_planet_111* (and so on) were moons based on the group they were added to.
4. Planets did not have their own rotation.
5. Asteroid field was missing.
6. Moons are not rotating around planets. The planet and the moons were added to the same group, but their position or rotation was not modified.
